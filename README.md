# Inksnek
Inksnek is a _Python_ class working in an Extension in _Inkscape_. It's evolved over 10 years to help me create (**_code_**) laser-cut enclosures like this:  
![design](enclosure.png)

The class provides helper methods for structuring a design in a hierarchy of groups and for adding cut lines as rectangles, circles and arbitrary paths etc.  
There is some build-in support for a simple stroked font.  
Refer to the docs directory for information about installation, programming and a reference.  
Also see the samples directory.
