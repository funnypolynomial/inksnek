# Inksnek
Inksnek is a _Python_ class working in an Extension in _Inkscape_. It's evolved over 10 years to help me create (**_code_**) laser-cut enclosures like this:

The class provides helper methods for structuring a design in a hierarchy of groups and for adding cut lines as rectangles, circles and arbitrary paths etc.  
There is some build-in support for a simple stroked font.  
Refer to the docs directory for information about installation, programming and a reference.  
Also see the samples directory.

I created the class to assist my creation of laser-cut project enclosures in _Inkscape 0.92_, to be sent to Ponoko.com.
I've modified it for **Inkscape 1.3.2**, cleaned it up, rationalised it. I don't use Ponoko any more but it still has some holdovers from that time (templates etc).  
I also wrote it in CamelCase but I have converted it to snake_case to be _slightly_ more Pythonic.
